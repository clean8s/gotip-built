### Precompiled dev versions of golang

Using `gotip` to run a dev version of go can delay
CI/unit tests for **4+ minutes**
since it isn't cached and goes through the whole toolchain process all the time.

This repo fixes that by storing precompiled daily gotip builds.


ðŸ’¾**Installation**:
```bash
go install github.com/clean8s/gotip-built/gotip@master
gotip download
```
Then you can use it as usual `go`: `gotip install`, `gotip mod tidy`, ...

ðŸ‘· As of October, the most useful merged feature is [fuzz testing](https://go.dev/blog/fuzz-beta), and of course, [Go generics](https://github.com/golang/go/labels/generics).

**Verifying download hash**: The `download` command outputs
the SHA-256 hash of the go source tar (it's calculated on-the-go as blocks get downloaded & uncompressed).
You can check whether it matches the artifact generated by
the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/clean8s/gotip-built/actions/workflows/gotip-dw.yml) - as well as verify the build steps.

**Supported platforms**: darwin_amd64, windows_amd64, linux_amd64
