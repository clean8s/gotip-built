### precompiled gotip

Using `gotip` can delay
CI/unit tests for **4+ minutes**
since it doesn't cache and goes through the whole toolchain process  all the time.

This repo fixes that by storing precompiled daily gotip builds.


ðŸ’¾**Installation**:
```bash
go install github.com/clean8s/gotip-built/gotip@master
gotip download
```
Then you can use it as usual go: `gotip mod tidy`, `gotip install`, `gotip version`, ...

---

**Verifying download hash**: The `download` command outputs
the SHA-256 hash of the go source tar (it's calculated on-the-go as blocks get downloaded & uncompressed).
You can check whether it matches the artifact generated by
the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/clean8s/gotip-built/actions/workflows/gotip-dw.yml) - as well as verify the build steps.

**Supported platforms**: darwin_amd64, windows_amd64, linux_amd64
